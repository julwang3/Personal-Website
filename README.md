# julwang.vercel.app/

My personal website built and deployed using:
- [React.js](https://react.dev/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (previously)
  - [Deploying React App](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

To push the React app to GitHub Pages with a commit message, run:
```
npm run deploy -- -m "[Description] - [Latest Commit ID]"
```
